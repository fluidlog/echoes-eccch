# SKOS Taxonomy for Echoes domains & activities

## Introduction
At the begining of echoes project, WP4 has selected some domains and activities to explain the project to partners.
This data was retrieved and used for cartography purposes.
Once this cartography was complete, we thought that other applications would need this taxonomy.

We therefore created this project to semantically annotate and standardize this taxonomy with the aim of making it reusable, as suggested by the FAIR principles.

In order to explain the technical concept from start to finish, we have described our use case.

Next, if the Echoes project (WP4) is approved, we will explain how to maintain such a semantic taxonomy, so that if the Echoes project creates a new version, applications can apply the change.
